<h2>Registration with mail activation in PHP &amp; MYSQL</h2>
<p>Nowadays web developers are creating user registration with mail activation. In my own opinion, some of the reasons behind this are:
EMail activation is primarily used to ensure that you're signing up with a real email address, and also one that you have access to and therefore you are the legitimate owner of the email address.</p>

<p>However, It takes care of some jokers(some end users of the site) who may submit funny data to the site.</p>
<h2>Download / Clone</h2>
<p>Clone using git</p>
<pre>git clone https://github.com/ngulajoseph200/registration-with-mail-activation-PHP-MYSQL-.git</pre>
<p>Download the zip folder and and extract the zipped files. Open the includes folder and edit the database config file(config.php) to match your database connections.</p>
